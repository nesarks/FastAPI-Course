# **FastAPI Learning Roadmap**

---

## **Week 1: Foundation Building**
- **Goal**: Understand the basics of APIs, HTTP, and get started with FastAPI.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 1–2**: What are APIs? Learn the purpose of APIs, real-world examples, and their importance.
  2. **Day 3–4**: HTTP Basics. Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and request/response structure.
  3. **Day 5–7**: Setting up FastAPI. Install Python, FastAPI, and Uvicorn. Build and run your first FastAPI app.

---

## **Week 2: Exploring FastAPI Core Features**
- **Goal**: Learn how FastAPI handles routes, path parameters, and query parameters.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 8–10**: Path Parameters. Create dynamic routes using path parameters.
  2. **Day 11–14**: Query Parameters. Handle optional inputs, default values, and validations.

---

## **Week 3: Data Validation and Response Models**
- **Goal**: Master data validation using Pydantic and control API responses.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 15–18**: Data Validation with Pydantic. Validate request data, explore nested models, and define custom rules.
  2. **Day 19–21**: Response Models and Serialization. Control API responses, exclude fields, and handle nested structures.

---

## **Week 4: Middleware and Dependencies**
- **Goal**: Add reusable components and global features to your APIs.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 22–24**: Middleware. Log requests, modify responses, and handle authentication globally.
  2. **Day 25–28**: Dependency Injection. Reuse components like database connections or authentication.

---

## **Week 5: Asynchronous Programming**
- **Goal**: Learn how to build high-performance APIs using `async` and `await`.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 29–32**: Asynchronous Routes. Understand the async/await syntax and how it improves performance.
  2. **Day 33–35**: Background Tasks. Run long-running tasks in the background.

---

## **Week 6: Database Integration**
- **Goal**: Integrate a database into your FastAPI project and perform CRUD operations.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 36–39**: Introduction to Databases. Learn SQL vs. NoSQL and set up a database.
  2. **Day 40–42**: CRUD Operations. Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using SQLAlchemy.

---

## **Week 7: Authentication and Security**
- **Goal**: Secure your APIs with authentication and proper security practices.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 43–45**: Authentication Basics. Implement OAuth2 with JWT for secure access.
  2. **Day 46–49**: Advanced Security. Handle HTTPS, CORS, and API keys.

---

## **Week 8: Testing and Deployment**
- **Goal**: Write tests and deploy your application to production.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 50–52**: Writing Tests. Write unit tests, mock dependencies, and perform integration testing.
  2. **Day 53–56**: Deployment. Dockerize your app and deploy it to the cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP).

---

## **Week 9: Advanced Features**
- **Goal**: Explore advanced FastAPI features and real-time APIs.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 57–59**: Real-Time APIs. Build APIs with WebSockets for real-time communication.
  2. **Day 60–63**: Rate Limiting and API Versioning. Prevent abuse and manage API versions.

---

## **Week 10–11: Building a Real-World Project**
- **Goal**: Apply everything you’ve learned to build a full-fledged project.
- **Topics**:
  1. **Day 64–67**: Project Setup. Define requirements and set up the project structure.
  2. **Day 68–72**: Core Features. Implement authentication, CRUD, and advanced features.
  3. **Day 73–77**: Testing and Deployment. Test and deploy the project to production.

---

## **Outcome**
By the end of this roadmap, you will:
- Be proficient in FastAPI and able to build production-ready APIs.
- Understand how to integrate databases, secure APIs, and handle real-time communication.
- Have hands-on experience building and deploying a real-world project.
